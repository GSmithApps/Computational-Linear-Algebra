# Computational-Linear-Algebra

This is just some notes from computational linear algebra. 

This repo also has some associated Jupyter notebooks on my Gists:

- [LU Decomposition](https://gist.github.com/GSmithApps/0d01edfe19f17a4391d77fe12e04a2d1 )
- [Matrix Multiplication](https://gist.github.com/GSmithApps/27eb10d72d9e855239d77feab9cd0586)
- [Gaussian Elimination](https://gist.github.com/GSmithApps/904bb98f6a5270249eeda3aa6a339a5d)
